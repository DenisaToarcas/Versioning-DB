->Declares a variable @TestRunId of type INT to store the identifier of the current test run.

INSERT INTO TestRuns (TestId, StartAt) VALUES (@TestId, GETDATE());

->Inserts a new record into the TestRuns table with the given @TestId and the current timestamp as the start time (StartAt).

SELECT @TestRunId = SCOPE_IDENTITY();

->Retrieves the identifier (TestRunId) of the recently inserted record using SCOPE_IDENTITY() function and assigns it to the variable @TestRunId.

->Inserts records into the TestRunTables table, capturing the test configuration for tables involved in the test run.
->Retrieves table configuration from TestTables based on the given @TestId.
->Records include the test run identifier (@TestRunId), table identifier (TableId), and the start time (StartAt).

->Executes a dynamic SQL statement to delete all records from the current table (@TableName).

EXEC('INSERT INTO ' + @TableName + ' SELECT TOP 1 * FROM ' + @TableName);

->Executes a dynamic SQL statement to insert a single record into the current table (@TableName). The SELECT TOP 1 * ensures that only one record is inserted.

FETCH NEXT FROM table_cursor INTO @TableName;

->Fetches the next table name from the cursor.

->Updates the EndAt field of the TestRuns table with the current timestamp, indicating the end time of the test run.
->This stored procedure is designed to run a test, record the start and end times, and capture performance data for tables and views involved in the test run.
